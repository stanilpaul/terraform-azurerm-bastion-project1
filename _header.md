# Bastion 

This module simulates one that would be created by the Support/Testing team for an architecture.
In this module, we will use it to create a Bastion host.

This is a very simple architecture, but we aim to simulate real-time IT team collaboration while following best practices.

* I created this module separately and last, to differentiate it from others. This makes it easier to manage, as in some cases, a bastion host is not required.
